# DO NOT RUN IT ON A HARDDRIVE THAT'S AT LEAST BIGGER THAN 400GB!
This code is just for experimenting a idea. Which is to generate a text file that contains all the possible combination of a BitLocker code.<br>
This is why I dind't provided any releases on this repo<br>
If you decide to run it anyway. You can do it. But at your own risk tho!
